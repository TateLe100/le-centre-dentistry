# Le-Centre-Dentistry

Start Date: 10.12.24

This is a personal project where I will be re-creating a website for my
uncle who owns his own practice in dentistry. He has a website that is
proficient but could use some updating.

This project I will be aiming to improve and also show off my skills in
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I also hope to get learn how to connect some sort of backend to save data dependent on if users want the dentistry to reach out to them.

Goals:

1. Simplistic, resposive website
2. Create some sort of back-end
3. Keep amount of pages to a few
4. add extra but necessary functionality

Stretch Goals:

1. form that has inputs to reach out and when user presses enter a email is
   sent to the user
